This is the part of a project that was ready enough to post online. The whole project has to do with getting Postgres Databases to maintain datasets that I have for various projects. 
That project is currently one of the many. 

This script though was kind of neat. It's basically a UI that I created that has buttons to complete the installation. When you go to install it right now it simply connects to "cowspeak" and tells jokes but the code is there to be continued when the vibe returns.
