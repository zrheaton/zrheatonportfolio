Some time ago I started backing up my personal photos outside of iCloud. When you download from icloud the photos come in HEIC format which is close to useless outside apple products. 
If you run this script on a directory of HEIC photos and provide an output directory it will convert everything to .jpg so you don't have to use sketchy websites. 

Fun fact. The HE in HEIC stands for "High Efficiency" so get read for your drive space to shrink considerably when you do this if you have a lot of photos.
