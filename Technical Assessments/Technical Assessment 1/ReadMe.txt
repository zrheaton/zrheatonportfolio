This project was completed as part of a technical assessment during my interview process for a technical position. For fairness and to respect the integrity of the process, the company name and exact role are not disclosed.

This assessment demonstrates my commitment to both excellence and personal growth. I believe itâ€™s valuable to share my work here to highlight my skills and approach to real-world challenges.

Technical assessments provide a way to showcase proficiency in relevant skills, and by making this available on my GitHub, I can demonstrate the competencies that drive my career forward.
